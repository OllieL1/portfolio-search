As part of a third year university course, six of us worked together for Thales UK to build an AI Map Generation Desktop App - Map Genie.\n\nThe concept was simple - the user inputs a plain English prompt on the UI, customises the styling of the map, and then a map opens in QGIS (map software) with the result of their query highlighted and the map nicely styled. An example use case would be 'Police stations in a 5-mile radius around Wembley Stadium'.\n\nI was our Product Owner which meant working frequently with our client to ensure our app was progressing aligned to his requirements. I also delivered the PyQGIS service of the project which included taking the result of the query and rendering the map in QGIS programmatically.\n\nI also built offline maps functionality where the user could save their QGIS map for offline use - a feature that required sockets programming to send and receive requests to QGIS from our front end.\n\nThis project also resulted in my greatest academic achievement to date: winning the Team Project award for our year group (the top six of 400 students).",
