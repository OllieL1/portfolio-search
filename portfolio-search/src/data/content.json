      "detail": "I was disappointed with the course content of one of my second year courses, Networked Systems. I reached out to my lecturer after the course offering my honest, non-anonymous feedback.\n\nIt was his first year taking the course and he asked if I could help during the summer to revamp and modernise the course. We worked closely together to redesign lecture slides, create weekly quizzes, and develop extended supplementary notes to aid future students with their learning.",

I own the UI portion of the project and so far I have designed, implemented, and deployed modernised screens that are now in the hands of business users.\n\nI have worked closely with stakeholders, adapted designs to changing requirements, and created feature-rich pages with powerful tools to visualise and filter data.\n\nThis role has been a complete change to my life - I have taken up much more sport, got into an actual cooking routine, and learned to appreciate free time a lot more. I am grateful to JP for all their efforts in making settling in a lot easier than I thought it would be.\n\nI have worked with a wonderful group of 12 IPs and going through this journey with them has made it all the more enjoyable.",

      "detail": "This is a project I am truly proud of. As part of a third year university course, six of us worked together for Thales UK to build an AI Map Generation Desktop App - Map Genie.\n\nThe concept was simple - the user inputs a plain English prompt on the UI, customises the styling of the map, and then a map opens in QGIS (map software) with the result of their query highlighted and the map nicely styled. An example use case would be 'Police stations in a 5-mile radius around Wembley Stadium'.\n\nI was our Product Owner which meant working frequently with our client to ensure our app was progressing aligned to his requirements. I also delivered the PyQGIS service of the project which included taking the result of the query and rendering the map in QGIS programmatically.\n\nI also built offline maps functionality where the user could save their QGIS map for offline use - a feature that required sockets programming to send and receive requests to QGIS from our front end.\n\nThis project also resulted in my greatest academic achievement to date: winning the Team Project award for our year group (the top six of 400 students).",

If I'm not playing one of football, tennis, or badminton, I will likely be in the pub watching them. I am an avid cook - check out the Cooking page for some of my recommendations.\n\nI am unfortunately a West Ham fan which has only really resulted in one brief season of joy in my life so far - but I'm sure they've got one or two left in them!\n\nIn a brief summary of myself, I always push myself to be outgoing and friendly. I love meeting new people, hearing different perspectives, and exploring the world. Next destination for me is Hong Kong in January!\n\nI'm happy for a chat with anyone, work or non-work related - please feel free to reach out at oliverlivingston@iCloud.com or via LinkedIn.",
